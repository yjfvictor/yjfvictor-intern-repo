# Company Reflection: Focus Bear

## Why do you think Focus Bear was created?

Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) represents a significant challenge that affects individuals personally and the broader community. Research indicates that reduced productivity attributable to ADHD costs the United States economy approximately US$87–138 billion annually. Children with ADHD encounter substantially greater difficulties with study compared to neurotypical children. Furthermore, untreated ADHD adversely impacts relationships, financial stability, and virtually every aspect of daily life.

The founder, Jeremy Nagel, is a late-diagnosed individual with AuDHD (autism and ADHD), who experienced considerable challenges with productivity and maintaining healthy habits. In seeking a solution that would effectively support him in completing essential activities such as yoga rather than engaging in distracting behaviours like scrolling through digital devices, he discovered that existing productivity and wellness apps were insufficient for his needs. Consequently, he developed Focus Bear as an anti-distraction and anti-burnout app specifically designed to assist individuals with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

## What problem is Focus Bear solving?

1. **Block distractions**: Users can engage in deep work with distraction blocking across all devices. Removing blocks is allowed in emergencies.
2. **Start the day right**: Focus Bear guides users through a morning routine that will boost their focus throughout the day. It is customisable as everyone is different.
3. **Eliminate Decision Fatigue**: Focus Bear bridges this cognitive gap by showing the habit routines users have chosen every morning and evening (and also during breaks). Once users set their routines, they appear automatically each day, so users never have to worry about what comes next.
4. **Use visual cues to increase focus**: Focus Bear bundles in visual protocols that enhance concentration based on research from Balcetis and colleagues.
5. **Increase Motivation**: Users can gain a holistic perspective of their goal-directed behaviour without having to manually track everything. Every week, Focus Bear automatically tracks users' breaks, routine completion, and time worked and displays a beautiful graph of how well they are doing.

## Why do you think this mission is important?

This mission is important because of the following reasons:

1. There are increasing numbers of people who suffer from ADHD and ASD.
2. Most productivity and wellness apps and tools do not work well for neurodivergent brains.
3. The internet and smart phones have a negative impact on productivity.
4. Hyper-focus can be dangerous, so breaks are needed to prevent burnout.

## How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?

1. It is beneficial for those seeking help with ADHD and ASD.
2. Focus Bear's commitment to behavioural science shows the company cares about real impact, not just marketing.
3. The team members are neurodivergent themselves, so they built the app to solve their own problems, which shows authentic empathy and understanding.
4. The team's focus on making routines feel playful, flexible, and rewarding, instead of restrictive, shows a commitment to human-centred design that respects how people actually work and think.

## Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?

Yes, I do experience difficulties focusing on work at times, especially when the work is challenging. Helping me focus on specific tasks can improve my productivity.
