# Learning Goals & Reflection

## What do you hope to learn from this internship?

I hope to learn how to build backend systems that genuinely help people, particularly those with neurodivergent conditions like ADHD and ASD. As a backend developer working with NestJS, I am excited to understand how behavioural science principles can be translated into robust, scalable backend solutions that support real behavioural change. Additionally, I want to learn about the backend architecture of Focus Bear, how it integrates with frontend systems, and how to implement features that effectively address user needs from a technical perspective.

## What skills are you most excited to develop?

I am most excited to develop:

- **Backend architecture skills**: Deepening my understanding of NestJS and learning how to design scalable, maintainable backend systems
- **API design and implementation**: Creating well-structured APIs that effectively support frontend features and user workflows
- **Database design and optimisation**: Learning how to model data structures that support behavioural tracking and habit routines
- **Cross-language interface integration**: Building on my strength in working with cross-language interfaces to integrate backend services with various frontend technologies
- **Collaboration in agile teams**: Working effectively in an agile team environment with clearly defined roles and collaborative brainstorming sessions

## What do you think you can contribute to the team?

I can contribute:

- **Quick learning and adaptation**: My ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies will help me become productive rapidly and contribute to backend development tasks
- **Creative algorithmic solutions**: I can implement creative algorithmic solutions for complex backend problems, such as habit tracking, routine management, and behavioural data processing
- **Cross-language interface expertise**: My strength in working with cross-language interfaces can help ensure smooth integration between backend services and frontend systems
- **Well-documented code**: I value comprehensive documentation and well-commented code, which will help maintain code quality and make the codebase more accessible to the team
- **Structured approach**: My preference for clear structure and detailed specifications means I will produce well-organised, maintainable backend code

## What is one area you feel less confident in that you'd like to improve?

I'd like to improve my ability to maintain focus and productivity when working on challenging backend tasks, especially when dealing with complex problems that lack clear structure. This is actually one of the reasons I am drawn to Focus Bear's mission—I can both contribute to solving focus challenges for others while learning strategies to improve my own focus through the product we're building. Additionally, I'd like to develop more confidence in making architectural and technical decisions for backend systems, particularly when requirements are initially unclear or ambiguous. I want to get better at asking clarifying questions proactively and breaking down complex problems into structured, manageable components.

## What does success in this internship look like for you?

Success for me would mean:

- **Backend development mastery**: Becoming proficient in NestJS and contributing meaningful backend features that support Focus Bear's core functionality
- **Architectural understanding**: Gaining a comprehensive understanding of Focus Bear's backend architecture, database design, and API structure
- **Meaningful technical contributions**: Successfully implementing backend features that genuinely help users with ADHD and ASD, such as habit tracking systems, routine management APIs, or behavioural data processing
- **Improved focus and productivity**: Using the strategies and tools we're building to improve my own ability to maintain focus during deep work sessions
- **Professional growth**: Developing confidence in making technical decisions, asking clarifying questions when requirements are unclear, and working effectively in an agile team environment
- **Code quality impact**: Contributing well-documented, well-commented backend code that follows best practices and makes the codebase more maintainable
