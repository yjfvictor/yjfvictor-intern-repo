## What Makes Focus Bear Different from These Apps?

### Focus Bear vs. Freedom & Cold Turkey (Blocking-Focused Apps)

**Key Differences:**

1. **All-purpose Approach vs. Pure Blocking**
   - **Freedom** and **Cold Turkey** are primarily distraction-blocking tools. They excel at preventing access to websites and apps but offer limited support for building positive habits or routines.
   - **Focus Bear** combines blocking with proactive habit-building through morning and evening routines, making it more comprehensive for long-term behavioural change.
2. **Neurodivergent-First Design**
   - While Freedom and Cold Turkey are general productivity tools, **Focus Bear** is specifically designed for individuals with ADHD and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
   - Focus Bear addresses challenges like decision fatigue, time blindness, and hyper-focus, in other words, issues that blocking apps alone don't solve.
3. **Routine Integration**
   - Focus Bear's morning and evening routines are deeply integrated with its blocking features, creating a structured start and end to the day.
   - Freedom and Cold Turkey focus on blocking during work sessions but don't provide the same level of routine guidance.
4. **Cross-Device Phone Integration**
   - Focus Bear's "Zen Mode" automatically puts your phone into a distraction-free state when you start deep work on your computer, which is a seamless integration that competitors don't offer in the same way.

### Focus Bear vs. Tiimo (ADHD Planning App)

**Key Differences:**

1. **Blocking vs. Planning Focus**
   - **Tiimo** is primarily a visual planning and scheduling app with strong ADHD-friendly features like AI co-planning, visual timelines, and task breakdown.
   - **Focus Bear** focuses more on blocking distractions and building routines, with less emphasis on detailed day planning and task management.
2. **Visual Design Philosophy**
   - Tiimo offers extensive visual customisation (colours, icons, fonts, dyslexia-friendly options) and a timeline view that helps with time blindness.
   - Focus Bear's visual protocols are more focused on enhancing concentration during work sessions rather than comprehensive visual planning.
3. **AI Capabilities**
   - Tiimo's AI co-planner helps break down tasks and estimate time, creating flexible schedules.
   - Focus Bear uses AI for blocking (determining if sites/apps are relevant to your focus goal) rather than planning assistance.
4. **Task Management Depth**
   - Tiimo provides more sophisticated task management with subtasks, priorities, drag-and-drop reordering, and calendar integration.
   - Focus Bear is less focused on task management and more on habit routines and focus sessions.

### Focus Bear vs. Routinery (Habit Routine App)

**Key Differences:**

1. **Routine Structure**
   - **Routinery** is entirely focused on building and executing routines with timer-guided steps, voice prompts, and visual feedback.
   - **Focus Bear** includes routines but combines them with blocking, focus sessions, and progress tracking, making it a more comprehensive productivity solution.
2. **Flexibility During Routines**
   - Routinery allows more granular control during routines (pause, skip, adjust duration on the fly) and offers preset routines like "Miracle Morning."
   - Focus Bear's routines are more integrated with the overall app experience but may be less flexible for 
3. **Distraction Blocking**
   - Routinery doesn't offer website or app blocking. It is purely about routine execution.
   - Focus Bear's blocking capabilities are a significant differentiator that Routinery lacks.
4. **Progress Visualisation**
   - Both apps track progress, but Routinery uses gamification (badges, growing plants) and detailed analytics on actual vs. target times.
   - Focus Bear provides weekly graphs of routine completion, breaks, and time worked, with a more holistic view of goal-directed behaviour.

## If You Were a User, Why Would You Choose Focus Bear Over Competitors?

### Reasons to Choose Focus Bear:

1. **Comprehensive Solution for Neurodivergent Users**
   - If you have ADHD or ASD, Focus Bear addresses multiple challenges in one app: blocking distractions, building routines, managing hyperfocus, and reducing decision fatigue. You wouldn't need separate apps for blocking (Freedom/Cold Turkey) and routines (Routinery).
2. **Seamless Cross-Device Integration**
   - The automatic phone "Zen Mode" when starting computer work sessions is a unique feature that creates a truly distraction-free environment across devices.
3. **Built by Neurodivergent People**
   - The team's lived experience means the app is designed with authentic understanding of the challenges it aims to solve, rather than being a general productivity tool adapted for neurodivergent users.
4. **Anti-Burnout Focus**
   - Focus Bear's break suggestions, hyperfocus detection, and meeting detection show it understands that productivity isn't just about blocking d
5. **Behavioural Science Foundation**
   - The integration of research-backed visual protocols and habit-building principles provides confidence that the features are based on evidence, not just assumptions.

### When You Might Choose a Competitor Instead:

- **Choose Freedom or Cold Turkey** if you only need strict blocking and don't want routine guidance or habit-building features.
- **Choose Tiimo** if you need sophisticated task planning, visual scheduling, and AI-assisted day planning more than blocking capabilities.
- **Choose Routinery** if you want a dedicated routine app with extensive preset options and don't need distraction blocking.

## What's One Feature That Other Apps Have That Focus Bear Doesn't?

### Feature: AI-Assisted Task Planning and Scheduling (from Tiimo)

**What it is:**
Tiimo's AI co-planner allows users to type or speak prompts like "Help me plan my day" or "Prepare for a meeting," and the AI breaks tasks into smaller steps, estimates time, and builds a flexible schedule.

**Why it's valuable:**

- Reduces task initiation paralysis by breaking large, ambiguous tasks into actionable steps
- Helps with time estimation, which is a common challenge for people with ADHD
- Creates realistic schedules based on actual capacity rather than idealised plans
- Allows flexible rescheduling without losing flow as the day changes

**Why Focus Bear might benefit from this:**
While Focus Bear excels at blocking distractions and building routines, it doesn't provide the same level of task breakdown and day planning. Users might still struggle with knowing *what* to work on during their focus sessions, even if distractions are blocked. An AI planning feature could help users:

- Break down complex projects into manageable focus sessions
- Estimate how long tasks will take (addressing time blindness)
- Create flexible daily schedules that integrate with Focus Bear's routines and focus modes
- Reduce decision fatigue about what to tackle next

This would make Focus Bear a more complete productivity solution, combining blocking, routines, and intelligent planning in one app.

## Based on Your Research, What's One Improvement You Think Focus Bear Could Make?

### Improvement: Enhanced Visual Customisation and Sensory-Friendly Design Options

**Current State:**
Focus Bear includes visual protocols for concentration, but it doesn't appear to offer the same level of visual customisation as apps like Tiimo, which provides extensive options for colours, icons, fonts (including dyslexia-friendly), and theming.

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Neurodivergent Users Have Diverse Needs**: People with ADHD and ASD often have different sensory preferences and sensitivities. Some may need high-contrast colours, others may need muted tones. Some may benefit from larger fonts or specific typefaces.
2. **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Customisable interfaces allow users to create an environment that feels comfortable and reduces distractions from the app itself, not just external websites.
3. **Accessibility**: Dyslexia-friendly fonts, adjustable text sizes, and colour contrast options make the app more accessible to a wider range of neurodivergent users.
4. **Personalisation Increases Engagement**: When users can make the app feel like "theirs," they're more likely to use it consistently.

**Specific Recommendations:**

- Add customisable colour themes (beyond just light/dark mode)
- Offer dyslexia-friendly font options (like OpenDyslexic or similar)
- Allow users to adjust font sizes and UI element sizes
- Provide options to customise icons and visual elements in routines
- Consider offering "sensory profiles" that pre-configure settings for common preferences (e.g., "low stimulation," "high contrast," "minimalist")

**Impact:**

This improvement would make Focus Bear more inclusive and comfortable for its target audience, potentially increasing user retention and satisfaction. It aligns with the app's mission of being designed specifically for neurodivergent users, as it acknowledges the diversity within that community.

## Summary

Focus Bear occupies a unique position in the productivity app market by combining distraction blocking, habit-building routines, and neurodivergent-focused design. While competitors excel in specific areas (Freedom/Cold Turkey in blocking, Tiimo in planning, Routinery in routines), Focus Bear offers a more holistic solution for users who need comprehensive support for ADHD/ASD-related challenges.

However, there are opportunities for improvement, particularly in visual customisation and potentially in AI-assisted task planning, which could make Focus Bear an even more complete productivity solution.
