### Key Roles in an Agile Team

#### Developers

Developers are responsible for designing, building, and maintaining the software product. They collaborate to translate user stories and requirements into working code, write tests, and ensure technical quality. In Agile teams, developers participate in planning, estimation, and retrospectives, contributing technical insights and taking ownership of delivery. They work closely with QA to ensure code quality and with the Product Manager to clarify requirements.

#### QA (Quality Assurance)

QA specialists focus on ensuring product quality through testing, bug identification, and validation of requirements. They create test plans, execute manual and automated tests, and verify that features meet acceptance criteria. In Agile teams, QA is involved early in the development process (shift-left testing), collaborating with developers during development rather than only testing at the end. They help define acceptance criteria and provide feedback on testability of features.

#### Product Manager (PM)

The Product Manager represents the customer and business needs, prioritising the product backlog and defining what should be built. They write user stories, define acceptance criteria, and make decisions about features and priorities. The PM collaborates closely with developers to clarify requirements, answer questions, and ensure the team is building the right thing. They balance stakeholder needs, market demands, and technical constraints.

#### Agile Project Manager (Agile PM)

The Agile Project Manager (or Scrum Master in Scrum frameworks) facilitates the Agile process, removes impediments, and helps the team work effectively. They organise ceremonies (stand-ups, retrospectives, planning), protect the team from interruptions, and coach the team on Agile practices. Unlike traditional project managers who manage tasks and timelines, Agile PMs focus on enabling team self-organisation and continuous improvement.

#### Stakeholders

Stakeholders provide input on requirements, priorities, and business value. They participate in reviews and demos to provide feedback and validate that the product meets their needs.

#### UX (User Experience) Designers

UX designers research user needs, create wireframes and prototypes, and ensure the product is usable and meets user expectations. They collaborate with developers to ensure designs are feasible and with PMs to align on user needs.

#### Customer Support

Customer support teams provide feedback from end users, report bugs, and share insights about how the product is used in practice. This feedback informs the product backlog and helps prioritise fixes and improvements.

### Collaboration in Kanban vs. Scrum

#### Scrum

- **Roles**: Defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers) with clear responsibilities
- **Collaboration**: Structured ceremonies (Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, Retrospective) create regular touchpoints
- **Planning**: Sprint-based planning where the team commits to work for a fixed period
- **Interaction**: More formalised interactions through ceremonies, with the Scrum Master facilitating collaboration

#### Kanban

- **Roles**: More fluid roles; team members may wear multiple hats
- **Collaboration**: Continuous collaboration through the Kanban board and ad-hoc discussions
- **Planning**: Continuous planning and reprioritisation as work flows through the board
- **Interaction**: More informal, flow-based interactions; collaboration happens as needed when work items move through stages

**Key Difference**: Scrum provides structured collaboration through time-boxed ceremonies, while Kanban enables continuous collaboration through visual workflow management and WIP limits that naturally create collaboration points.

## 📝 Reflection

### My Role and Contribution to the Agile Process

**My Role**: I am a **Backend Developer** (intern) working on NestJS at Focus Bear.

**How I Contribute**:

- I translate user stories and requirements into working backend code and APIs
- I participate in planning and estimation, providing technical insights on feasibility and effort
- I collaborate with QA to ensure code quality and testability
- I work with the Product Manager to clarify requirements and understand the "why" behind features
- I contribute to retrospectives by sharing what went well and what could be improved
- I maintain technical quality through clean code, documentation, and following best practices

**My Responsibilities in the Agile Flow**:

1. **Planning**: Help estimate effort and identify technical dependencies
2. **Development**: Build features incrementally, writing code that meets acceptance criteria
3. **Testing**: Write unit tests and work with QA to ensure quality
4. **Review**: Participate in code reviews and provide feedback to peers
5. **Retrospective**: Reflect on the process and suggest improvements

### How My Responsibilities Overlap or Interact with Other Roles

**With Product Manager (PM)**:

- I clarify requirements and technical constraints when user stories are unclear
- I provide input on technical feasibility that influences prioritisation
- I ask questions to understand the business context and user needs

**With QA**:

- I collaborate during development to ensure testability
- I fix bugs identified during testing
- I write unit tests that complement QA's integration and end-to-end tests
- We work together to define and meet acceptance criteria

**With Other Developers**:

- We conduct code reviews to maintain quality and share knowledge
- We pair program or collaborate on complex features
- We share technical knowledge and best practices

**With Agile PM/Scrum Master**:

- I communicate blockers and impediments that need to be addressed
- I participate in ceremonies and provide feedback on process improvements
- I help maintain team velocity by delivering on commitments

**With UX Designers**:

- I provide technical feedback on design feasibility
- I ensure backend APIs support the frontend user experience requirements

## 🛠️ Task

### How My Role Fits into the Agile Team

As a **Backend Developer**, I am a core contributor to the Agile team's delivery of value. My role fits into the Agile process by:

1. **Translating Requirements into Working Software**: I take user stories and acceptance criteria from the Product Manager and implement them as backend services, APIs, and business logic. This is the core of delivering value in Agile: turning ideas into working code.

2. **Participating in Continuous Feedback Loops**: I engage in daily stand-ups to share progress and blockers, participate in planning to estimate and commit to work, and contribute to retrospectives to improve our process. This aligns with Agile's emphasis on frequent communication and adaptation.

3. **Collaborating Across Roles**: I work closely with QA to ensure quality, with PMs to clarify requirements, and with other developers through code reviews. This cross-functional collaboration is essential to Agile's value of "individuals and interactions over processes and tools."

4. **Delivering Incrementally**: I build features in small, testable increments that can be delivered frequently. This supports Agile's principle of "deliver working software frequently" and enables early feedback.

5. **Maintaining Technical Excellence**: I write clean, maintainable code with tests and documentation. This supports Agile's principle of "continuous attention to technical excellence" and ensures the team can sustain its pace.

6. **Adapting to Change**: When requirements change or new information emerges, I adapt my implementation rather than rigidly following an initial plan. This embodies Agile's core value of "responding to change over following a plan."

In Focus Bear's Kanban environment, my role is particularly fluid. I pull work from the backlog as capacity allows, collaborate continuously through the board and ad-hoc discussions, and adapt quickly when priorities shift.

### Collaboration with Another Role: Product Manager (PM)

**Role I Frequently Collaborate With**: **Product Manager (PM)**

**Current Collaboration**:

- I receive user stories and requirements from the PM
- I ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- I provide technical feedback on feasibility and effort
- I participate in planning discussions to understand priorities

**How I Can Improve Teamwork with the PM**:

1. **Proactive Communication**: Instead of waiting for requirements to be fully specified, I can proactively reach out early in the planning process to discuss technical considerations and potential challenges. This helps the PM make more informed decisions about prioritisation and scope.

2. **Understanding the "Why"**: I can ask more questions about the business context and user needs behind features. Understanding the "why" helps me make better technical decisions and suggest alternative solutions that might better meet the underlying need.

3. **Early Technical Input**: I can provide technical insights during backlog refinement, helping the PM understand dependencies, technical debt implications, and opportunities for technical improvements that could enable future features.

4. **Clear Status Updates**: I can provide clear, concise updates on progress and blockers, using the structured communication style the PM prefers (bullet points, clear details). This helps the PM manage stakeholder expectations and adjust priorities if needed.

5. **Suggesting Improvements**: I can suggest technical improvements or refactoring that could make future features easier to implement, helping the PM understand the long-term value of technical investments.

6. **Documentation**: I can ensure that technical decisions and API contracts are well-documented, making it easier for the PM to understand what has been built and communicate this to stakeholders.

By improving these aspects of collaboration, I can help the PM make better-informed decisions, and the PM can help me understand requirements more deeply, leading to better outcomes for the team and the product.
