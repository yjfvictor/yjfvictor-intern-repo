# Agile Principles

## Module 1: Research & Learn

### What is Agile, and how does it differ from traditional project management?

Agile is an iterative, incremental approach to delivering value through short feedback cycles, continuous learning, and adaptable plans. Traditional project management (often “waterfall”) tends to be plan-driven, with fixed scope, sequential phases, and change managed through formal approvals. Agile prioritises responsiveness to change and frequent delivery over comprehensive upfront planning and rigid phase gates.

### Core values and principles of Agile

#### Values

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

#### Principles

- Satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development
- Deliver working software frequently
- Business and developers collaborate daily
- Build around motivated individuals and trust them
- Prefer face-to-face communication
- Working software is the primary measure of progress
- Maintain a sustainable pace
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design
- Simplicity is essential
- Best solutions emerge from self-organising teams
- Regularly reflect and adjust behaviour

### Differences between Scrum and Kanban, and when each is used

Scrum is a time‑boxed framework using fixed‑length sprints, defined roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developers), and ceremonies (planning, daily scrum, review, retrospective). It suits work that benefits from batching into sprint goals and regular review cycles.  
Kanban is a flow‑based method focused on continuous delivery, limiting work in progress (WIP), and visualising work on a board. It suits environments with fluctuating priorities or ongoing operational work where continuous flow and rapid reprioritisation are needed.

### Why Focus Bear leans towards Kanban instead of Scrum

Focus Bear tends to prefer Kanban because product work, fixes, and operational tasks often arrive continuously and need flexible prioritisation. Kanban’s WIP limits and flow metrics support steady delivery without the overhead of sprint planning and re‑planning when priorities shift.

## Reflection

### Biggest benefits and challenges of Agile

#### Benefits

- Faster feedback and higher adaptability
- Earlier value delivery and visibility
- Stronger collaboration and ownership

#### Challenges

- Requires disciplined communication and transparency
- Scope can drift without clear prioritisation
- Teams must balance speed with technical quality

### How Agile principles can improve my role and responsibilities

Agile encourages me to seek frequent feedback, keep work visible, and deliver in small increments. This helps me de‑risk tasks, collaborate earlier, and adapt quickly if requirements change, leading to more reliable and valuable outcomes.

## Task

### Main differences between Scrum and Kanban

Scrum is about committing to a sprint goal and delivering a batch of work in a fixed time box, with structured roles and ceremonies to inspect and adapt at sprint boundaries. Kanban is about keeping work flowing continuously, limiting WIP, and reprioritising as new information arrives, without strict time boxes.

### One Agile principle most useful to my work

“Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.” It keeps me focused on delivering the best outcome rather than rigidly following an outdated plan.
