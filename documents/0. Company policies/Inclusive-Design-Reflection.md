# 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Working with Vulnerable Populations

## 🎯 Goal

Understand how to **interact respectfully and responsibly** when working with or designing for vulnerable populations, including neurodivergent individuals.

## ❓ Why is this important?

Focus Bear is designed to support **people with ADHD and Autism**, as well as others who struggle with executive functioning. Many users face **challenges with focus, motivation, and frustration tolerance**, so we need to ensure our work is **supportive, inclusive, and ethical**.

Additionally, some of our **own team members are neurodivergent**, which means we should be mindful of **communication styles, collaboration needs, and workplace accessibility** for both users and colleagues.

## 🔍 Research & Learn

### Who are **considered vulnerable populations**, and what challenges might they face in digital spaces?

Vulnerable populations include individuals who may experience barriers to accessing services or participating fully in society due to factors such as:

- **Cognitive differences** (e.g., neurodivergent individuals with ADHD, Autism, dyslexia, or other learning differences)
- **Physical disabilities** (e.g., mobility impairments, vision or hearing loss)
- **Socioeconomic disadvantages** (e.g., limited access to technology or education)
- **Health conditions** (e.g., chronic illness, mental health conditions)
- **Age-related factors** (e.g., elderly users or children)
- **Language barriers** (e.g., non-native speakers, limited literacy)

**Challenges in Digital Spaces:**

Neurodivergent individuals, particularly those with ADHD and Autism, often face specific challenges in digital environments:

1. **Sensory Overload**
   - Bright colours, flashing animations, or complex layouts can be overwhelming
   - Background noise, autoplay videos, or multiple simultaneous notifications can cause distress
   - High contrast or busy visual designs can lead to sensory discomfort

2. **Cognitive Load**
   - Complex navigation structures can be difficult to process and remember
   - Dense information without clear hierarchy can be overwhelming
   - Multiple steps or decisions can lead to decision paralysis
   - Working memory limitations may make it hard to track progress through multi-step processes

3. **Inaccessible Communication**
   - Ambiguous language, jargon, or complex sentences can lead to misunderstandings
   - Lack of clear instructions or multiple interpretation pathways
   - Missing or unclear error messages that don't explain what went wrong or how to fix it
   - Unpredictable interface behaviour that doesn't match expectations

4. **Executive Function Challenges**
   - Difficulty initiating tasks, especially when the first step is unclear
   - Challenges with task switching or transitioning between features
   - Time blindness or difficulty estimating how long tasks will take
   - Difficulty maintaining focus when there are competing stimuli or distractions

5. **Frustration Tolerance**
   - Low tolerance for errors or unexpected behaviour
   - Difficulty recovering from mistakes when the error path isn't clear
   - Anxiety when systems don't behave predictably

### What **ethical considerations** are important when designing or working with neurodivergent individuals?

Ethical considerations are crucial when designing for or working with neurodivergent individuals, as excluding them can lead to unintended harms:

1. **Avoid Overwhelming UX**
   - Design interfaces that minimise sensory overload by using simple layouts
   - Avoid unnecessary animations or flashing elements
   - Provide options to reduce visual complexity (e.g., "focus mode" or "simple view")
   - Break down complex tasks into manageable, clear steps

2. **Respect Sensory Needs**
   - Provide options to adjust sensory inputs (customisable colour schemes, brightness levels)
   - Allow users to disable animations or autoplay features
   - Offer adjustable sound/notification settings
   - Support user-driven customisation for contrast, typography, and motion preferences

3. **Ensure Clear Communication**
   - Use straightforward, jargon-free language
   - Provide clear instructions in multiple formats (text, visual, audio where appropriate)
   - Offer confirmation messages and clear feedback
   - Explain errors clearly and provide actionable next steps
   - Make expectations explicit and transparent

4. **Avoid Exclusion from Design Process**
   - Involve neurodivergent individuals as co-creators in the design process
   - Test with neurodivergent users throughout development, not just at the end
   - Avoid making assumptions about needs. Listen to actual user experiences
   - Recognise that excluding neurodivergent users can lead to increased anxiety, exclusion from essential services, and perpetuation of digital inequality

5. **Respect Autonomy and Agency**
   - Provide choices and control over how users interact with the system
   - Avoid forced paths or "one-size-fits-all" solutions
   - Allow users to customise their experience according to their needs
   - Respect different ways of processing information and completing tasks

6. **Privacy and Data Protection**
   - Be transparent about how user data is collected and used
   - Provide clear consent mechanisms that are easy to understand
   - Protect sensitive information about users' disabilities or needs
   - Comply with privacy regulations including Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
   - Note: Health and disability information may constitute special category personal data under GDPR Article 9, requiring enhanced protections and explicit consent or other lawful basis

## 📝 Reflection

### How can you **adjust your communication style** to be more inclusive of neurodivergent users and teammates?

To be more inclusive, I can adjust my communication style in several ways:

1. **Clarity and Explicitness**
   - Use clear, direct language without relying on hints or implied meanings
   - Provide explicit instructions rather than assuming context is understood
   - State expectations clearly rather than leaving them implicit
   - Break down complex requests into simple, actionable steps

2. **Multiple Formats**
   - Provide important information in both written and verbal formats
   - Use visual aids (diagrams, screenshots) alongside text explanations
   - Offer summaries or bullet points in addition to longer explanations
   - Provide written documentation for verbal discussions

3. **Patience and Understanding**
   - Allow time for processing without rushing responses
   - Be patient with questions and requests for clarification
   - Recognise that asking for clarification is a strength, not a weakness
   - Avoid judgment when communication styles differ

4. **Structure and Predictability**
   - Use consistent formats for communication (e.g., email templates, meeting agendas)
   - Provide context and background when introducing new topics
   - Give advance notice of changes or new information
   - Use clear subject lines and headings to organise information

5. **Validation and Support**
   - Acknowledge challenges and frustrations without minimising them
   - Offer support proactively rather than waiting to be asked
   - Recognise that people may need different levels of detail or support
   - Celebrate successes and progress, even small steps

### What are some **common UX or communication pitfalls** that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive?

Common pitfalls that could make Focus Bear less accessible include:

1. **Cognitive Overload**
   - Too many features or options visible at once
   - Complex navigation requiring multiple clicks to reach common functions
   - Dense information without clear visual hierarchy
   - Multiple competing stimuli (animations, notifications, visual elements) that distract from the primary task

2. **Unclear Communication**
   - Jargon or technical language that assumes prior knowledge
   - Vague error messages that don't explain what went wrong or how to fix it
   - Missing or unclear instructions for how to use features
   - Ambiguous button labels or actions (e.g., "Submit" vs. "Save" vs. "Continue")

3. **Lack of Predictability**
   - Inconsistent navigation or layout patterns across different screens
   - Unexpected behaviour when clicking buttons or links
   - Changes to familiar features without clear communication
   - Unclear consequences of actions (e.g., "Will this delete my data?")

4. **Sensory Overload**
   - Bright colours, high contrast, or busy visual designs
   - Autoplay animations or sounds
   - Flashing elements or rapid transitions
   - Too many notifications or alerts appearing simultaneously

5. **Executive Function Barriers**
   - Unclear starting points (e.g., "How do I begin?")
   - Lack of progress indicators, making it hard to see advancement
   - No way to pause and resume tasks without losing context
   - Complex onboarding that requires too much upfront cognitive effort

6. **Limited Customisation**
   - No options to adjust visual settings (contrast, font size, colours)
   - Cannot disable animations or reduce motion
   - Fixed layouts that don't accommodate different preferences
   - No way to save or restore preferred configurations

7. **Frustration with Errors**
   - No clear way to undo mistakes
   - Errors that delete or lose user work
   - Unhelpful error messages that don't explain solutions
   - Lack of recovery paths when things go wrong

8. **Inflexible Communication**
   - Only one way to receive information or instructions
   - No options for different levels of detail or explanation
   - Assumes users process information the same way
   - Doesn't accommodate different reading or comprehension speeds

### What is one **practical change** you can make in your work to better support vulnerable populations?

One practical change I can make is to **always provide written summaries and clear action items** in communications, especially for important or complex topics. This means:

1. **After Meetings or Discussions:**
   - Send a follow-up email with key points, decisions, and action items
   - Use bullet points or numbered lists for clarity
   - Highlight deadlines and expectations explicitly
   - Include links or references to related materials

2. **In Written Communications:**
   - Use clear headings and structure to organise information
   - Provide context before asking for action
   - Break complex requests into numbered steps
   - Include examples or screenshots when explaining concepts

3. **When Providing Instructions:**
   - Start with the goal or purpose ("To accomplish X...")
   - List steps in order with clear action verbs
   - Include what success looks like ("You'll know it worked when...")
   - Provide alternative approaches if one method doesn't work

4. **For User-Facing Content:**
   - Write in simple, jargon-free language
   - Provide multiple ways to access the same information (text, visual, step-by-step)
   - Include clear "next steps" or calls to action
   - Test content with the question: "Could someone understand this if they're feeling overwhelmed or stressed?"

This change recognises that:

- **Written information** can be processed at one's own pace and reviewed multiple times
- **Clear structure** reduces cognitive load and helps with task initiation
- **Multiple formats** accommodate different processing styles
- **Explicit action items** reduce ambiguity and support executive functioning

By consistently applying this practice, I can better support neurodivergent users and colleagues who may process information differently or need information presented in more accessible ways.

## 🛠️ Task

### Read a **first-person account** from someone with ADHD or Autism about their experiences with productivity tools

**Source:** ["My Productivity/ Knowledge Management System: A Guide from a Neurodivergent Person"](https://adrianagabsalot.medium.com/my-productivity-knowledge-management-system-a-guide-from-a-neurodivergent-person-a42b7351f06a) by Adriana (March 2025)

**Account Summary:**

Adriana, an autistic person with ADHD, shares her journey of creating a productivity system that works for her neurodivergent brain. Her account provides valuable insights into the challenges and solutions for neurodivergent individuals using productivity tools.

**Key Challenges and Insights:**

1. **Traditional Methods Don't Work**: Adriana tried "dated planners, undated planners, notebooks, bullet journals, even giant calendar whiteboards, and none of it ever stuck." The time required to create bullet journal spreads or time-block her day was enough to deter her from using these tools. She realised: "The time it took to create 'bujo' spreads or time block my day in a planner alone, was enough to deter me from picking them up because the tasks I had to do felt daunting."

2. **The Problem Isn't the Brain. It's the Format**: A crucial realisation was that "my brain wasn't the problem. It was the fact that I was using an incompatible format." She uses a powerful analogy: "I was shoving a Samsung charger into an iPhone and was shocked it wasn't charging 🤷‍♀️." This highlights the importance of finding tools that match how neurodivergent brains work, rather than trying to force the brain to work with incompatible systems.

3. **Visual-Spatial Memory Challenges**: Adriana explains that "visual-spatial memory problems are common in Autism and ADHD folks, 'out of sight, out of mind' taking on a whole new meaning." This means information needs to be visible and accessible, not hidden in notebooks or complex folder structures.

4. **The Need for Balance**: She emphasises finding "the right balance of structure and flexibility." Some people need rigid structure, others need more flexibility. For her, "I prefer a more abstract, flexible knowledge management and productivity system because I'm prone to information overload."

5. **Anxiety from Unmanaged Tasks**: Before creating her system, she "felt like I could never relax because I was constantly waiting for someone to pop out of the hedges and say, 'Hey, weren't you meant to sign this form?'" The anxiety and "gravity of the giant to-do list" were "crippling" and made her want to "curl up in a ball, my feelings of guilt and shame consuming me."

6. **Digital Tools Work Better**: Going digital was a "game changer" because apps have "great integration features" and help build "a cohesive management system where I'm not scrambling to find a particular notebook or highlight in a paperback that I haven't seen in months." Reminders and notifications on her watch mean she "can't ignore or forget about them."

7. **The "Second Brain" Concept**: Adriana uses Tiago Forte's "Building a Second Brain" approach, which is "an external, centralized, digital repository for the things you learn and the resources from which they come." As an autistic person, her goal is "to delegate the task of remembering to a management system outside of my brain, and to reserve my mental and physical energy for things that actually matter to me, like creativity, mindfulness, or spending time with loved ones."

8. **Learning Curve Considerations**: She acknowledges that "there is absolutely a learning curve" for tools like Notion, and importantly notes: "There's no point in having a fancy productivity system if you don't know how to use the features." This highlights the importance of usability and not overwhelming users with complex features.

9. **Flexibility Over Rigidity**: Her system is "flexible enough that you can use it in whatever way you'd like, organise notes in whatever form you want and still reap the benefits." She emphasises that "your needs are always changing," so systems must adapt.

10. **Her Philosophy**: "It's not stupid if it works", a reminder that what matters is effectiveness, not following conventional productivity advice.

**Tools She Uses:**

- **Akiflow**: Calendar and to-do list integration ("if it's not in my Akiflow, it's not happening")
- **Notion**: Long-term project documentation and admin information
- **Obsidian**: Note-taking with internal linking to visualise connections between concepts
- **Readwise**: Automatically imports reading highlights and notes

**Key Takeaway for Focus Bear:**

Adriana's account emphasises that productivity tools must balance structure with flexibility, make information visible (addressing "out of sight, out of mind"), reduce cognitive load, and allow users to delegate remembering to the system rather than burdening their working memory. The system should work for the user's brain, not force the user to work for the system.

### Identify **one design or communication improvement** that could make Focus Bear more accessible

**Proposed Improvement: "Visible Progress" Dashboard with Flexible Structure**

Based on Adriana's account, particularly her emphasis on visual-spatial memory challenges ("out of sight, out of mind") and the need for balance between structure and flexibility, I would propose implementing a **"Visible Progress" dashboard** that addresses these specific neurodivergent needs:

**Key Features:**

1. **Always-Visible Task Context**
   - A persistent, always-visible panel showing current focus session, recent progress, and upcoming tasks
   - Information remains visible even when switching between app screens or features
   - Addresses the "out of sight, out of mind" challenge by keeping important information in view
   - Customisable position (top, side, or bottom) to accommodate different preferences

2. **Flexible Structure with Smart Defaults**
   - Pre-configured templates for different working styles (rigid time-blocking vs. flexible abstract management)
   - Users can start with sensible defaults but customise as needed
   - "Your needs are always changing", easy to adjust structure without losing data
   - No forced workflows: users can adapt the system to their brain, not vice versa

3. **Integration and Reminder System**
   - Integration with calendar apps and task managers (like Adriana's Akiflow integration)
   - Smart reminders that appear on multiple devices (watch, phone, desktop) so users "can't ignore or forget about them"
   - Gentle, non-intrusive notifications that support rather than overwhelm
   - Option to delegate remembering to the system: "If it's not in Focus Bear, it's not happening"

4. **Reduced Cognitive Load Through Delegation**
   - Automatic saving of progress and sessions (delegating memory to the system)
   - Visual progress indicators that don't require mental tracking
   - Clear visualisation of connections between tasks, sessions, and goals (inspired by Obsidian's linking concept)
   - "Second Brain" approach: the app remembers so the user doesn't have to

5. **Simple Onboarding with Progressive Disclosure**
   - Start with one-click focus session (addressing the "time to set up" barrier)
   - Advanced features hidden initially but easily accessible when ready
   - Acknowledges that "there's no point in having a fancy productivity system if you don't know how to use the features"
   - Learning resources available but not forced

6. **Forgiving and Flexible Design**
   - Easy to undo mistakes or change approach
   - No judgment for adjusting goals, changing structure, or using the app differently
   - Philosophy: "It's not stupid if it works", whatever helps the user is valid
   - Support for different working styles without forcing one approach

**Why This Improves Accessibility:**

- **Addresses Visual-Spatial Memory**: Always-visible information prevents "out of sight, out of mind" problems
- **Balances Structure and Flexibility**: Provides structure for those who need it, flexibility for those who don't
- **Reduces Cognitive Load**: Delegates remembering to the system, freeing mental energy
- **Respects Individual Differences**: Allows customisation without judgment
- **Prevents Overwhelm**: Progressive disclosure and smart defaults prevent information overload
- **Supports Executive Function**: Integration and reminders help with task initiation and follow-through

This improvement directly addresses Adriana's key insights: the need for visible information, flexible structure, system-based memory delegation, and tools that work with neurodivergent brains rather than against them.

### Practice writing **a clear, patient, and supportive response** to a hypothetical user struggling with executive functioning

**Hypothetical User Scenario:**

A user emails support saying: "I keep trying to use Focus Bear but I get overwhelmed. There are too many options and I don't know where to start. Every time I open it, I feel stressed and just close it. I really want to use it but it's just too much. Can you help?"

**Practice Response:**

```markdown
Subject: Help Getting Started with Focus Bear

Hi Adriana,

Thank you so much for reaching out. I really appreciate you sharing this with us. Your experience is completely valid, and you're definitely not alone in feeling this way.

**First, I want you to know:** Your brain isn't the problem. Sometimes we just need to find the right way to use a tool that works with how your brain works, not against it. Let's figure out what works for you.

**Let's start super simple, just one thing:**

When you open Focus Bear, look for the big "Start Focusing" button. That's literally all you need to click. Everything else? Ignore it for now. You can explore later, or never, which is totally fine.

**Try this once:**

1. Open Focus Bear
2. Click "Start Focusing"
3. That's it. You're done.

You don't need to set a timer, choose a task, or do anything else. Just click that button and let it run. When you want to stop, click "Stop." That's it.

**A few things that might help:**

- **Your progress saves automatically:** you can't lose anything, even if you close the app or forget about it
- **There are no rules:** use it for 2 minutes or 2 hours, it doesn't matter
- **You can't break it:** click around, explore, or don't. Whatever works for you
- **It's okay to forget:** if you forget to use it for days or weeks, that's fine. Just come back when you're ready

**If even that feels like too much:**

That's completely okay. Maybe Focus Bear isn't the right tool for you right now, and that's valid. There's no shame in that. Productivity tools should help, not add stress.

**If you want to try again later:**

- Would a short video help? (Just showing the one button)
- Would written instructions with screenshots be better?
- Or would you prefer to just leave it for now and come back when you're ready?

**Remember:** The goal is to find what works for you. If Focus Bear doesn't work, that's not a failure. It's just not the right fit. And if you want to try again, we're here to help in whatever way works best for you.

Take care,
Victor Yeh
Focus Bear Support

**P.S.** If reading this email feels overwhelming, that's okay too. Just know: you're not doing anything wrong, and we're here when you need us.
```

**Why This Response is Effective:**

1. **Validates and Normalises**: Acknowledges the experience and normalises it ("your brain isn't the problem")
2. **Reframes the Problem**: Uses Adriana's insight that the issue is often the format/tool, not the user
3. **Minimal Steps**: Provides the absolute simplest possible starting point
4. **Reduces Pressure**: Multiple reassurances that there's no "right" way and no judgment
5. **Acknowledges It Might Not Be the Right Tool**: Validates that not every tool works for everyone
6. **Flexible Support Options**: Offers different ways to get help without forcing any
7. **Respects Autonomy**: Emphasises finding what works for the individual
8. **Anticipates Overwhelm**: The P.S. recognises that even the response might be too much
9. **Non-Judgmental**: Never makes the user feel bad about struggling or not using the tool
10. **Philosophy Alignment**: Reflects "it's not stupid if it works", whatever helps is valid
