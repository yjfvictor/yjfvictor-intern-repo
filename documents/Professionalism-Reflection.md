### What does **respectful communication** look like in remote teams?

At Focus Bear, we maintain a professional approach in our communications while embracing remote work flexibility. This means:

**Tone and Language:**

1. **Be Clear and Direct**
   - Use straightforward language without being abrupt
   - Avoid ambiguity that could lead to misunderstandings
   - Provide context when introducing new topics or requests
   - Use "I" statements when expressing concerns ("I noticed..." rather than "You always...")

   - Be mindful of time zones and cultural differences (especially important in remote work)

   - Recognise that written communication lacks tone and body language
   - Use emojis or indicators (like "😊" or "FYI") to convey tone when helpful (appropriate for our casual culture)
   - Assume good intent when interpreting others' messages

**Handling Disagreements:**

1. **Address Issues Directly and Privately**
   - Discuss disagreements one-on-one first before escalating
   - Focus on the issue, not the person
   - Use "I" statements to express your perspective
   - Listen actively to understand the other person's viewpoint

2. **Seek Common Ground**
   - Look for shared goals or values
   - Propose solutions rather than just identifying problems
   - Be willing to compromise when appropriate
   - Recognise when to agree to disagree and move forward

3. **Escalate Appropriately**
   - If a disagreement can't be resolved directly, involve a supervisor or mediator
   - Document the issue and attempts to resolve it
   - Focus on finding a solution rather than assigning blame

**Responding to Feedback:**

1. **Listen First**
   - Don't interrupt or become defensive immediately
   - Ask clarifying questions to fully understand the feedback
   - Take time to process before responding if needed
   - Thank the person for providing feedback

2. **Assume Good Intent**
   - Recognise that feedback is usually meant to help you improve
   - Separate the feedback from your emotional response
   - Focus on what you can learn or improve

3. **Take Action**
   - Acknowledge valid points in the feedback
   - Create a plan to address the feedback
   - Follow up to show you've taken the feedback seriously
   - Ask for additional clarification or support if needed

**Remote-Specific Considerations for Communications:**

1. **Asynchronous Communication** (Flexibility + Professionalism)
   - Be clear about response time expectations (acknowledging flexibility while maintaining standards)
   - Use status indicators (available, busy, away) appropriately
   - Don't expect immediate responses unless it's urgent (respecting flexibility)
   - Provide all necessary context in your initial message (professional thoroughness)

2. **Video Calls** (Meeting attendance aspect)
   - Be on time and prepared (professional meeting attendance)
   - Use video when it adds value (relationship building, complex discussions)
   - Respect others' preferences about camera use (flexibility in remote work)
   - Be mindful of background, lighting, and audio quality (professional approach)

3. **Written Communication**
   - Use clear subject lines in emails
   - Structure messages with headings or bullet points for readability

### How can you **give and receive feedback professionally**?

**Giving Feedback:**

1. **Focus on Actions, Not People**
   - Describe specific behaviours or outcomes rather than character traits
   - Example: "I noticed the report was submitted after the deadline" rather than "You're always late"
   - Focus on what can be changed or improved

2. **Be Specific and Constructive**
   - Provide concrete examples rather than vague generalisations
   - Explain the impact of the behaviour
   - Offer suggestions for improvement when appropriate
   - Balance constructive criticism with recognition of strengths

3. **Choose the Right Time and Place**
   - Give feedback in a timely manner (not too long after the event)
   - Use private channels for sensitive feedback
   - Ensure the recipient is in a good state to receive feedback
   - Schedule dedicated time for feedback rather than catching someone off-guard

4. **Use the SBI Framework (Situation-Behaviour-Impact)**
   - **Situation**: Describe the specific context
   - **Behaviour**: Describe the observable behaviour
   - **Impact**: Explain the effect on you, the team, or the project

5. **Assume Good Intent**
   - Start from the assumption that people are trying their best
   - Frame feedback as helping them succeed
   - Avoid accusatory language

**Receiving Feedback:**

1. **Listen Actively**
   - Give your full attention to the person providing feedback
   - Don't interrupt or become defensive
   - Take notes if helpful
   - Ask clarifying questions to ensure you understand

2. **Separate Feedback from Self-Worth**
   - Recognise that feedback is about specific actions or outcomes, not your value as a person
   - View feedback as an opportunity to grow
   - Don't take it personally

3. **Ask for Clarification**
   - If feedback is unclear, ask for specific examples
   - Request suggestions for how to improve
   - Ask about the impact of your behaviour
   - Seek to understand the other person's perspective

4. **Take Time to Process**
   - It's okay to need time to think about feedback before responding
   - You can say: "Thank you for this feedback. I'd like to take some time to reflect on it, and then we can discuss next steps."
   - Process your emotional response before reacting

5. **Follow Up**
   - Acknowledge the feedback and thank the person

### How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?

**Initial Follow-Up (Within 1-2 Business Days):**

1. **Send a Polite Reminder**
   - Reference the original request and context
   - Acknowledge they may be busy
   - Restate what information or action is needed
   - Provide a new deadline if appropriate
   - Example: "Hi [Name], just following up on my message from [date] about [topic]. I know you're busy, but I wanted to check in on [specific request]. Would it be possible to get this by [date]? Let me know if you need any additional information."

2. **Make It Easy to Respond**
   - Provide all necessary context in the follow-up
   - Offer to discuss via call if that's easier
   - Suggest alternative solutions if possible
   - Be flexible about format or timing

**Second Follow-Up (After 3-5 Business Days):**

1. **Escalate Within the Relationship**
   - If it's a supervisor, mention the impact of the delay
   - Offer to help or take on part of the task if possible
   - Suggest a brief call to discuss if there are blockers
   - Example: "Hi [Name], I wanted to follow up again on [request]. This is blocking [specific task/project], so I wanted to check if there's anything I can do to help move this forward. Would a quick call be helpful?"

2. **Provide Context on Urgency**
   - Explain why the information or action is needed
   - Share the impact of the delay
   - Offer flexibility on timing if possible
   - Suggest alternatives if appropriate

**Escalation (After 1 Week or If Urgent):**

1. **Involve Supervisor or Manager**
   - If the request is to a colleague, involve their supervisor
   - If the request is to my supervisor, involve their manager
   - Provide context about the original request and follow-ups
   - Explain the impact of the delay
   - Example: "Hi [Supervisor], I wanted to let you know that I've been waiting on [information/action] from [Name] for [timeframe]. I've followed up [number] times, and this is currently blocking [specific impact]. Could you help facilitate this or suggest an alternative approach?"

2. **Find Alternative Solutions**
   - Look for other ways to get the information needed
   - Identify if someone else can help
   - Determine if the request can be modified or simplified
   - Consider if the task can proceed without this information

3. **Document the Situation**
   - Keep records of requests and follow-ups
   - Note the impact of delays
   - Document attempts to resolve the issue
   - This helps if further escalation is needed

**When to Escalate:**

1. **Urgency-Based Escalation**
   - If the delay is blocking critical work or deadlines
   - If the request is time-sensitive
   - If waiting longer would cause significant problems
   - Escalate immediately for urgent matters

2. **Time-Based Escalation**
   - After 1 week with no response for non-urgent matters
   - After 2-3 business days for moderately urgent matters
   - Immediately for urgent or critical matters
   - Consider the person's role and typical response time

3. **Impact-Based Escalation**
   - If the delay is affecting other team members or projects
   - If it's preventing progress on important work
   - If it's causing frustration or inefficiency
   - If it's becoming a pattern

**Best Practices:**

1. **Be Respectful and Professional**
   - Always maintain a respectful tone
   - Assume good intent (they may be busy or have other priorities)
   - Don't be accusatory or demanding
   - Focus on the work impact, not personal blame

2. **Provide Context**
   - Explain why the information or action is needed
   - Share the impact of delays
   - Provide all necessary background information
   - Make it clear what you need and why

3. **Offer Solutions**
   - Suggest alternatives or workarounds
   - Offer to help or take on part of the task
   - Be flexible about format or timing
   - Propose ways to make it easier for them

4. **Know When to Wait**
