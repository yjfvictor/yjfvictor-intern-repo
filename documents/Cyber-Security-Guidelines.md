## 🔍 Research & Learn

### What are common cyber security threats in a remote work environment?

Common cyber security threats in remote work environments include:

1. **Phishing Attacks**: Fraudulent emails, messages, or links designed to steal credentials or install malware
2. **Unsecured Wi-Fi Networks**: Public or home networks without proper encryption can expose data to interception
3. **Weak Authentication**: Reusing passwords or not using 2FA makes accounts vulnerable
4. **Malware and Ransomware**: Malicious software that can compromise devices and data
5. **Social Engineering**: Manipulation tactics to trick employees into revealing sensitive information
6. **Unsecured Devices**: Lost or stolen devices without encryption or remote wipe capabilities
7. **Shadow IT**: Using unauthorized applications or services that may not meet security standards
8. **Video Conferencing Vulnerabilities**: Unauthorized access to meetings or screen sharing exploits
9. **Physical Security Risks**: Leaving devices unlocked or unattended in public spaces
10. **Cloud Storage Misconfiguration**: Improperly configured cloud services exposing sensitive data

### What are best practices for keeping your devices and accounts secure?

Best practices include:

- **Use strong, unique passwords** for each account (12+ characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
- **Enable two-factor authentication (2FA)** on all accounts that support it
- **Keep software updated** (operating system, applications, browsers) to patch security vulnerabilities
- **Use a VPN** when connecting to public or untrusted networks
- **Install and update antivirus/anti-malware software** regularly
- **Encrypt your devices** (full disk encryption on laptops, encryption on mobile devices)
- **Be cautious with email attachments and links** - verify sender before clicking
- **Use secure, password-protected Wi-Fi** or VPN at home
- **Enable automatic screen lock** with short timeout periods
- **Back up data regularly** using secure, encrypted backup solutions
- **Limit administrative privileges** - use standard user accounts for daily work
- **Review app permissions** regularly and remove unnecessary access

### Why is it important to lock your computer when away from your desk?

Locking your computer when away is critical because:

1. **Prevents Unauthorized Access**: Anyone passing by cannot access your work, emails, or company data
2. **Protects Sensitive Information**: Screens may display confidential documents, customer data, or internal communications
3. **Reduces Risk of Data Theft**: Physical access is one of the most dangerous security threats
4. **Compliance Requirements**: Many regulations require physical security measures for data protection
5. **Prevents Tampering**: Unlocked computers can be used to install malware, change settings, or steal credentials
6. **Builds Security Culture**: Consistent locking behaviour reinforces security awareness for the entire team
7. **Protects Company Reputation**: A single breach from an unlocked device can damage trust

**Best Practice**: Set automatic lock after 5-10 minutes of inactivity, and manually lock (Windows: Win+L, Mac: Cmd+Ctrl+Q) whenever stepping away, even briefly.

### How should you handle phishing attempts and suspicious links?

When encountering phishing attempts or suspicious links:

1. **Don't Click Immediately**: Hover over links to see the actual URL before clicking
2. **Verify the Sender**: Check the email address carefully - look for slight misspellings or unusual domains
3. **Look for Red Flags**:
   - Urgent language or threats ("Your account will be closed!")
   - Requests for passwords, credit card info, or personal details
   - Poor grammar or spelling
   - Unexpected attachments
   - Generic greetings ("Dear Customer" instead of your name)
4. **Verify Through Official Channels**: If an email claims to be from a service, log in directly (not through the link) to verify
5. **Report Suspicious Emails**: Forward phishing attempts to your IT/security team
6. **Delete and Block**: Remove suspicious emails and block senders when appropriate
7. **Don't Download Attachments**: Never open attachments from unknown or suspicious sources
8. **When in Doubt, Ask**: Contact your supervisor or IT team if uncertain about an email's legitimacy
9. **Check URLs Carefully**: Look for HTTPS, verify domain names, watch for typo-squatting
10. **Trust Your Instincts**: If something feels off, it probably is - don't take the risk

### What makes a strong password, and why should you use a password manager?

**Strong Password Characteristics:**
- **Length**: At least 12-16 characters (longer is better)
- **Complexity**: Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- **Uniqueness**: Different password for each account/service
- **Randomness**: Avoid dictionary words, personal information (birthdays, names), or patterns
- **Example of strong password**: `K7#mP$vN2@xQ9!wR` (random, complex)

**Why use a password manager?**

1. **Generate Strong, Unique Passwords**: Creates random, complex passwords you don't need to remember
2. **Store Passwords Securely**: Encrypted storage protects your credentials
3. **Prevent Password Reuse**: Each account gets a unique password, limiting breach impact
4. **Convenience**: Auto-fill functionality saves time while maintaining security
5. **Multi-Device Sync**: Access passwords across devices securely
6. **Breach Monitoring**: Many managers alert you if your credentials appear in data breaches
7. **Reduces Cognitive Load**: You only need to remember one master password
8. **Secure Sharing**: Some managers allow secure password sharing with team members
9. **Password Strength Analysis**: Helps identify weak or reused passwords
10. **Compliance**: Helps meet security requirements for strong password policies

**Popular Password Managers**: 1Password, LastPass, Bitwarden, Dashlane, Apple Keychain

### Why is two-factor authentication (2FA) important, and when should you enable it?

**Why 2FA is important:**

1. **Extra Layer of Security**: Even if your password is compromised, attackers need your second factor
2. **Protects Against Credential Theft**: Passwords alone are vulnerable to phishing, breaches, and keyloggers
3. **Significantly Reduces Attack Success Rate**: Makes unauthorized access much more difficult
4. **Industry Best Practice**: Considered essential for protecting sensitive accounts
5. **Regulatory Compliance**: Many regulations require multi-factor authentication for certain data
6. **Peace of Mind**: Provides confidence that your accounts are better protected
7. **Immediate Notification**: You're alerted when someone tries to access your account

**When to enable 2FA:**

- [x] **All work accounts** (email, productivity tools, cloud services)
- [x] **Financial accounts** (banking, payment services, investment platforms)
- [x] **Email accounts** (primary and backup)
- [x] **Cloud storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive)
- [x] **Social media accounts** (especially if used for work)
- [x] **Developer accounts** (GitHub, GitLab, cloud platforms)
- [x] **Admin/administrative accounts** (any account with elevated privileges)
- [x] **Personal accounts with sensitive data** (health records, tax services)
- [x] **Any account that offers 2FA** (when available, always enable it)

**2FA Methods (from most to least secure):**
1. Hardware security keys (YubiKey, Titan Key)
2. Authenticator apps (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
3. SMS codes (less secure but better than nothing)
4. Email codes (least secure, only if no other option)

### How can you make secure behaviour a habit rather than an afterthought?

To make secure behaviour a habit:

1. **Start Small and Build Gradually**: Begin with one security practice (e.g., always locking screen) and make it automatic before adding more
2. **Use Triggers and Cues**: Pair security actions with existing routines (lock computer when standing up, check email sender before opening)
3. **Make It Easy**: Use tools that automate security (password managers, automatic locks, auto-updates)
4. **Set Reminders**: Use calendar reminders or phone alerts for periodic security tasks (password reviews, software updates)
5. **Practice Mindfulness**: Pause before clicking links, opening attachments, or sharing information - ask "Is this secure?"
6. **Track Your Progress**: Keep a simple checklist of security habits and review weekly
7. **Reward Compliance**: Acknowledge when you've successfully followed security practices
8. **Learn from Mistakes**: If you make a security error, analyse what happened and adjust your process
9. **Share with Team**: Discussing security practices with colleagues reinforces good habits
10. **Regular Review**: Set quarterly reviews to assess security habits and identify areas needing reinforcement

**Habit Stacking Examples:**
- Every time you stand up from your desk → Lock your computer
- Every time you receive an email → Check sender and hover over links
- Every time you create a new account → Generate strong password in manager and enable 2FA
- Every Monday morning → Review security settings and update software
