   - Can miss nuanced business requirements

### What types of information should never be entered into AI tools?

**NEVER** enter the following types of information into AI tools (especially publicly available ones):

1. **Personal Identifiable Information (PII)**
   - Names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses
   - Dates of birth, government ID numbers (e.g., Tax File Numbers, Medicare numbers)
   - Any information that can identify individuals

2. **Confidential Company Data**
   - Trade secrets and proprietary information
   - Financial data, revenue figures, budgets

**Key Principle**: If you're unsure whether information is safe to share, **don't share it**. When in doubt, consult with your supervisor or the IT/security team.

**OAIC Guidance**: The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner advises against entering personal information into publicly available AI tools, as it becomes difficult to control how this data is used, stored, or processed.

### How can you fact-check and validate AI-generated content to ensure accuracy?

**Critical Validation Steps:**

1. **Cross-Reference with Reliable Sources**
   - Verify facts against authoritative sources (official websites, peer-reviewed articles, documentation)
   - Check multiple independent sources to confirm information
   - Look for primary sources rather than secondary summaries

2. **Human Oversight & Expert Review**
   - Have subject matter experts review AI-generated content
   - Consult with colleagues who have relevant expertise
   - Seek feedback from supervisors or team members

3. **Use Critical Thinking**
   - Question the logic and coherence of AI outputs
   - Look for inconsistencies, contradictions, or red flags
   - Assess whether the information makes sense in context
   - Consider alternative perspectives

4. **Test & Verify**
   - For code: Test thoroughly, run unit tests, check for security vulnerabilities
   - For data: Verify calculations, check against known values
   - For claims: Look for evidence and citations (and verify those citations exist)

5. **Check for Hallucinations**
   - Verify that cited sources actually exist and say what the AI claims
   - Check that code examples actually work
   - Confirm that facts are current and accurate
   - Be especially cautious with specific numbers, dates, or technical details

6. **Review for Bias & Appropriateness**
   - Check for cultural bias or inappropriate assumptions
   - Ensure content is appropriate for Australian/Victorian context
   - Verify compliance with local laws and regulations

7. **Compare with Known Information**
   - Cross-check against company documentation or policies
   - Verify against your own knowledge and experience
   - Compare with similar work you've done before

8. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Use AI output as a starting point, not a final product
   - Edit, refine, and improve based on your expertise
   - Combine AI assistance with your own knowledge

9. **Document Your Process**
   - Note what AI tool was used and for what purpose
   - Document any edits or changes made to AI output
   - Keep records of fact-checking steps taken

10. **Stay Informed About AI Limitations**
    - Understand that AI can make mistakes
    - Know the training data cutoff dates
    - Be aware of common AI failure modes

**Best Practice**: Treat AI-generated content as a **draft that requires human review**, not a final product. Always apply your professional judgment.

   - Getting suggestions for improvement
   - Brainstorming ideas or alternatives
   - Refining and polishing work

4. **Data-Intensive Tasks**
   - Analysing large datasets (with appropriate privacy controls)
   - Pattern recognition in data
   - Generating summaries of lengthy content

5. **Non-Critical Tasks**
   - Tasks where errors can be easily caught and corrected
   - Internal documentation or drafts
   - Personal learning or experimentation

**Rely on your own skills when:**

1. **Critical Decision-Making**
   - Strategic business decisions
   - Matters affecting clients or customers
   - Financial or legal decisions
   - Performance evaluations or HR matters

2. **Sensitive or Confidential Information**

   - Compliance and regulatory matters

4. **Creative or Nuanced Work**
   - Tasks requiring deep understanding of context
   - Work that reflects company culture or values
   - Client-facing communications requiring personal touch
   - Complex problem-solving requiring domain expertise

5. **Final Deliverables**
   - Client-facing materials
   - Production code or systems
   - Official documentation
   - Public communications

**Key Principle**: Use AI as a **tool to enhance your work**, not as a replacement for your expertise, judgment, and critical thinking. Always maintain ownership and responsibility for the final output.

### How can you avoid over-reliance on AI while still benefiting from it?

**Strategies to Avoid Over-Reliance:**

1. **Set Clear Boundaries**
   - Define which tasks are appropriate for AI assistance
   - Establish when human judgment is required
   - Create personal guidelines for AI usage

2. **Maintain Your Skills**
   - Regularly practice tasks without AI assistance
   - Continue learning and developing expertise
   - Don't let AI become a crutch for basic skills

3. **Critical Evaluation Always**
   - Never accept AI output without review
   - Always question and verify AI suggestions
   - Treat AI as a starting point, not a final answer

4. **Understand the "Why"**
   - Learn why AI makes certain suggestions
   - Understand the underlying concepts, not just the output
   - Use AI to learn, not just to produce

5. **Balance AI and Human Input**
   - Use AI for initial drafts, but refine with your expertise
   - Combine AI suggestions with your own knowledge
   - Know when to override AI recommendations

6. **Regular Skill Checks**
   - Periodically complete tasks without AI to ensure you still can
   - Test your understanding independently
   - Maintain confidence in your abilities

7. **Use AI Selectively**
   - Don't use AI for every task
   - Choose when AI adds value vs. when it's unnecessary
   - Sometimes doing it yourself is faster and better

8. **Stay Informed**
   - Understand AI limitations and failure modes
   - Keep up with AI developments and best practices
   - Learn from mistakes (yours and others')

9. **Document Your Process**
   - Note when and how you used AI
   - Document what you changed or improved
   - Reflect on whether AI actually helped

10. **Seek Human Feedback**
    - Get input from colleagues and supervisors
    - Compare your AI-assisted work with your independent work
    - Learn from others' experiences

**Red Flags of Over-Reliance:**
- Feeling lost when AI is unavailable
- Accepting AI output without question
- Using AI for tasks you should be able to do yourself
- Reduced confidence in your own abilities
- Difficulty explaining your work without referencing AI

**Healthy AI Relationship**: AI should **augment** your capabilities, not replace them. You should be able to work effectively with or without AI assistance.
