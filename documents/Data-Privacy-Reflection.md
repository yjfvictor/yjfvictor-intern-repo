## 🛠️ Task

### Identify at least **one habit or practice** you can adopt to improve data security in your role

**Practice: "Verify Before Sharing" Protocol**

I will adopt a "Verify Before Sharing" protocol for all data sharing activities. This means:

1. **Before Sharing Any Data:**
   - Verify the identity of the person requesting data
   - Confirm they have a legitimate need and proper authorisation
   - Check if the minimum necessary data can be shared instead of full datasets
   - Use secure, encrypted channels for sharing

2. **Documentation:**
   - Keep a brief log of what data was shared, with whom, when, and why
   - Note the purpose and authorisation for sharing
   - This creates an audit trail and helps identify patterns

3. **Regular Review:**
   - Weekly review of data sharing activities
   - Identify any unnecessary sharing
   - Revoke access when no longer needed

**Why This Helps:**
- Prevents unauthorised access to sensitive data
- Ensures compliance with data minimisation principles
- Creates accountability and audit trails
- Reduces risk of accidental disclosure
- Builds good privacy habits

### Document at least one **key learning or security measure** you will implement

**Key Learning: Understanding Special Category Data Protections**

**Learning:**
Focus Bear collects "Special Category Personal Data" under GDPR Article 9, which includes:
- **Health information:** ADHD diagnoses, autism diagnoses, medication habits
- **Religious beliefs:** Implied through habits like "Read bible" or "Read Quran"

This data requires **enhanced protections** and explicit consent or other lawful basis under GDPR. Focus Bear handles this by:
- Double encrypting habit data
- Only accessing habits when users report problems and request assistance
- Keeping survey data anonymous and aggregated
- Not linking health/religious data to personal identifiers when possible

**Security Measure I Will Implement:**

1. **Enhanced Awareness of Special Category Data:**
   - Recognise when I'm working with health or religious data
   - Understand that this data requires extra care and protection
   - Be mindful that habits may reveal sensitive personal information

2. **Minimal Access Principle:**
   - Never access user habit data unless explicitly requested by the user for troubleshooting
   - Work with anonymised or aggregate data when possible
   - Avoid linking sensitive data to personal identifiers

3. **Respect User Privacy:**
   - Remember that users trust Focus Bear with sensitive health and lifestyle information
   - Treat all user data with the same level of care as special category data
   - Be transparent about data usage and respect user choices

4. **Compliance Awareness:**
   - Understand that mishandling special category data has serious legal consequences
   - Follow GDPR requirements for processing special category data
   - Report any concerns about special category data handling immediately

**Why This Matters:**
- Health and disability information is particularly sensitive and protected under GDPR
- Users with ADHD and autism trust Focus Bear with personal information
- Mishandling this data could cause significant harm and legal consequences
- Respecting user privacy builds trust and ensures compliance
